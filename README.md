# Paws Gallery

Browse through images of dogs and see them with full size.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/GeorgiNedyalkov/Paws-Gallery.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
yarn
```

3. Run the app

```
yarn dev
```

You are good to go!

## 📄 Requirements

Build a little application that displays a grid or list of dog images.
When clicking on an image you go to a detail page for that image.

There you can just delete the image. Deleting an image means that you will never display that
image in the grid again.(until reload, no persistence)

- use react 18
- use https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
- think about separating concerns
- upload the result to github and make sure we can easily install and run it

## 💻 Built with

- [React 18](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS: for styling](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Router DOM: for navigation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

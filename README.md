## Requirements

Build a little application that displays a grid or list of dog images.
When clicking on an image you go to a detail page for that image.

There you can just delete the image. Deleting an image means that you will never display that
image in the grid again.(until reload, no persistence)

- use react 18
- use https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
- think about separating concerns
- upload the result to github and make sure we can easily install and run it
- don't overdo it. this task is meant to be simple. I feel like maybe 2 hours of work should be enough
